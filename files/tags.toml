Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node or Deno. It was built from scratch to focus on three main things:
â€¢ Start fast (it has the edge in mind).
â€¢ New levels of performance (extending JavaScriptCore, the engine).
â€¢ Being a great and complete tool (bundler, transpiler, package manager).

To fix this error, you need to update Linux kernel.

  **2.** Run:
     â€¢ wsl --set-version <disto name> 2
       â€¢ If it throws `Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.`, turn on Virtual Machine Platform in Windows Features and then rerun this command.
       â€¢ PS: You can get distro name from `wsl --list -v` 
     â€¢ wsl --update
     â€¢ wsl --shutdown

If that doesn't work (and you're on a Windows machine), try this:
  **1.** Open Windows Update
